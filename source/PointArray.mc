    //
    // so we use ~100 bytes more per route/track (but the directions are included) - negligible (net 0 gain)
    // code size goes up by quite a bit though, 1725 bytes of extra code for a saving of 1200 per route (assuming we have at least 1 route active and the current track this is a net saving of 675 bytes)
    // for users that do not have routes, this is actually a negative, but thats not our normal use case
    // for users trying to have 3 large route, this is a very good thing (saves 3075 bytes)
    // but don't forget, we have added directions support, so we actually have used more memory overall (1700bytes code space), but gained a new feature.

    // but now i think we get watchdog errors, before it was memory errors though :(
    // we get watchdog errors on 3 large routes ~400 points and thats without a track
    // watchdog errors were in the rescale method, a relatively simple algorithm but now it has to do `x.encodeNumber(x.decodeNumber() * scale)` instead of just `x[i] = x[i] * scale`;
    // buts its also rescaling all the directions, so maybe its just the fact that we are at 400coords + 100 directions per route.

    // So after alot of testing I have decided to reverse the 'optimised byte array' changes
    // This is because although they are good for each route/track memory footprint, they are bad for code size (which is loaded into ram)
    // Its also bad for readability and finally the cpu hit is too high, causing watchdog errors
    // The watchdog errors are the one to be afraid of, they cannot be fixed and happen later on in the app lifecycle (it's much easier to test if a route/track memory footprint works as the app crashes straight away)
    // With memory optimised method I can only get at max 1150-1200 (1200 was rare and think it crashed) points across all routes/track before I start getting watchdog errors
    // With the high memory low cpu method the memory becomes the limiting factor
    // I can achieve 1443 points with the _internalArrayBuffer as Array<Float> which is enough for 3 full routes with directions, but don't forget about the track
    // note: This seems to be the real limit, as this gets watchdog errors at this point (off track calculations are huge)
    // So we should be able to do nearly 250 coordinates and 100 directions and have 3 routes, and a track 400*3 * 300 = 1500 points (though I think 100 directions is quite high)
    // This is only for worst case when we have 3 routes loaded (general use case is one route and 1 track) so it will easily fit 400coords per track and  route and 100 directions = 900 points
    // users could also get creative and send some of the routes without directions (swimming leg of triathlon)
